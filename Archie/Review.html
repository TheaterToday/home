        Cirque du Soleil was a very interesting piece, with very few words
        spoken and a lot of action. The actions spoke the words, which was
        enough for the audience to make out what was really happening on stage.
        The expressions and actions were very well done and clear. The stunts
        were very entertaining and mesmerizing to watch, flipping through
        objects, high jumps, etc. The lighting, colours, and props used
        throughout the play were very beautiful and eye-catching. However, the
        play was a bit confusing for me at the beginning, it really didn't make
        sense or have a beginning, middle or end. The show was very interesting
        to watch, but most events throughout the play had me puzzled.
      </p>

      <p>
        The audience sitting in front watching as the play goes on seemed very
        mind-blown by the stunts that they managed to pull. Just imagine how
        long they must've practiced for this. During the cat scene, many of the
        viewers were entertained and laughing by the expressions he gave. Who
        knew an individual can make someone laugh without any noise? The play
        also had the audience participate in the cat scene, which was very
        surprising and not expected. Deep inside, I believe the audience stayed
        entertained and mostly understood what was going on. They seemed very
        interested in the stunts and at the end of the performance, the claps
        given weren't just ordinary claps given for a presentation, it was more
        than just a play.
      </p>

      <p>
        This show was an excellent success and really spoke comedic language
        using only expressions. In particular, during KURIOS - Cabinet of
        Curiosities, I found not only myself but the whole crowd laughing at the
        brilliant act portrayed by Facundo Gimenez. His actions have really
        portrayed what he was trying to become, a cat. The movements, facial
        expressions, and sounds were all on point and really conveyed the
        importance of drama. This specific scene was very clear to me and I
        understood what exactly was going on. The protagonist was walking home
        from a rainy day, and when he reaches home, he stumbles upon a woman who
        knocks on his door. He has fallen in love with the beauty of the woman
        and greets her into the house. She sits beside him on a couch, and the
        actor tries to put his hand on her but sadly fails. He goes off to the
        kitchen to get drinks for the two, and the actor then transforms into a
        cat and plays his role as a cat. The cat makes his way to the couch
        where the girl was sitting and entertains the audience with the
        expressions given by the actor. The cat then leaves the scene and the
        man returns with the drinks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, this play was wonderfully done and I really hope to see much
        more plays done by Cirque du Soleil. Rating: 5/5
      </p>
