      <p>
        As the scene emerged from the dark, our view shifted to the
        old-fashioned laboratory, the curio cabinet, of “an ambitious inventor
        who defies the laws of time, space and dimension”. With a work of
        'magic', small globes of light illuminated inside a glass jar while the
        ticking of the clock chimed in the background. As the number on the
        clock reached 11:11, the ticking sped up and the entire laboratory
        drifted away. With a final buildup of music, actors lowered gracefully,
        as if from the end of time, behind white clouds of air from the ceiling
        as the music reached the climax. This was fascinating beginning the
        60-minute special #1 Cirque du Soleil had performed, composed of parts
        from KURIOS, “O”, and LUZIA.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Cirque du Soleil performance has, in general, a feeling of
        mysteriousness but also a sense of wildness. The mystical feeling rooted
        from the gears, the antique-looking KURIOS stage and costumes, and the
        baffling storyline. You would see men and women wearing cowboy clothing,
        juggling and dancing, as if gambling in a typical Old-West setting. In
        the background, you would hear bright staccato piano notes while artists
        danced and smiled wholeheartedly. Or, instead, you may hear dramatic
        music that creates a suspenseful atmosphere as the juggler performs an
        unbelievable trick. All of these well designed soundtracks had made the
        performance ever so interesting. Soon, the scene transitioned. One beam
        of glistening light shone on a sweet smiling woman and followed her as
        she rolled a boat on the outskirts of the stage in darkness, until she
        faded into a white mist. This type of lighting was used to emphasize the
        woman in order to make time for the other artists to transition.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wildness came from “O” and LUZIA, which, combined, resemble somewhat
        a jungle. For example, in “O”, a huge water pool was at the heart of the
        stage, with layers of thin curtains at the back, barely revealing the
        shadows of various human figures. About a dozen of performers were on a
        floating platform on top of the pool, performing aquatic acrobatics and
        complicated, elegant movements. The artists' costumes and makeup were
        what made them look inhuman and resemble mysterious wild animals. Their
        faces were colored with makeup the same color of their costume -- light
        green, magenta, and neon yellow. Their bodies were covered with stripes
        of colors but mostly skin color. These were what made audiences feel as
        if they were elves in a primitive, hidden world instead of the theater
        of a civilized world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, I rate this performance four and a half stars out of five. I
        highly recommend this free exciting opportunity to experience the
        fascinating world created by Cirque du Soleil. Despite that the story
        line was unclear, if any had even existed, this viewing experience would
        be absolutely enjoyable and astounding with much to appreciate.
