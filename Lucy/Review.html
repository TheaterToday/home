      <p>Rating: 4.5/5</p>

      <p>
        Cirque Du Soleil, the largest contemporary circus producer and
        Canadian-based company, has recently released a new show. The 60-Minute
        Special combines the company's three most popular performances: KURIOS:
        Cabinet of Curiosities, “O”, and LUZIA.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hour-long show is split into three segments. There is no plotline
        present; however, each segment has a background story and is centred
        around a strong theme.
      </p>

      <p>
        KURIOS, the opening performance, is about an ingenious inventor who
        travels to unfamiliar settings with his time machine. The performance
        takes inspiration from steampunk and late 19th-century aesthetics. I
        found the many aerial acrobatic acts breathtaking to witness. My one
        issue with KURIOS lies with the act where the actor imitates a cat - it
        dragged on too long and was a bit cringeworthy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second show, “O”, is a mesmerizing water-based performance dedicated
        to the beauty of water. I found the set of this show the most memorable.
        The performers swim in sync in the large pool. Lighting was used
        craftily to create silhouettes in the background that depicted the
        setting. “O” also features a standout act where a grand skeleton of a
        ship is raised above the water; the performers precariously sway the
        ship from side to side while performing daunting acrobatics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout all of this, the consistent synchronization and wonderful
        soundtrack enriches their performances tenfold. Cirque du Soleil's
        exemplary performances are what all theaters should aspire to be like,
        and while in these unprecedented times nothing is for certain, I know
        I'll be going back for a second heaping bowl of Cirque du Soleil.
      </p>

      <p>
        LUZIA is the last show and graces the production with a powerful ending.
        The show is a vivid depiction of Mexican culture. The jaguar prop,
        although having a brief appearance, was memorable for its detailed and
        lifelike design. I take note of how the audience is seated very close to
        the stage, making the experience much more immersive.:
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the show had virtually no dialogue, the background music was
        vital to setting the tone of each act. For instance, the soundtrack
        grows louder and more urgent whenever the performers are about to pull
        off a dangerous trick. The music of KURIOS and “O” was particularly
        catchy; the snappy Bella Donna Twist was my favourite piece. I, for one,
        will be listening to the soundtrack again even after the show.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lighting was utilized thoughtfully to draw attention to performers and
        to change the tone of the show by adjusting the darkness. The fog was a
        special effect used in-between acts to create a sense of anticipation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The costumes the actors wore enforced the themes of each show. Steampunk
        attire for KURIOS, exotic neon swimsuits for “O”, and the colourful
        cultural outfits for LUZIA were sometimes bizarre but contributed to the
        uniqueness and novelty of the show.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I would have enjoyed a show with a narrative, the lack of story is
        compensated by the spectacle Cirque du Soleil always manages to deliver.
        If you are someone who enjoys witnessing thrilling acts and intricate
        set designs, a ticket to the 60-Minute Special is something for you.
