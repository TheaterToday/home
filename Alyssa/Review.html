    <p>The other day, I watched a group from Cirque du Soleil called KURIOS perform a show, Cabinet of Curiosities. Overall, I found the performance incredible and I would say they combined all their elements perfectly. There was a huge variety of fascinating movements incorporated throughout the show that I was afraid to miss even a second of it!
    </p>

    <p>The show started with an inventor wearing a loose white lab coat carrying a beige-coloured briefcase. As the show commenced, machines started to move around the stage, lightbulbs started to flicker, you can hear crackling noises coming from his inventions, and three people in wild costumes descended from the sky while a woman in the background was singing. When I analyzed this scene, I assumed that everything happening on stage represented the inventor's imagination coming to life. Although so much was happening at once, the music playing in the background of all the chaotic scenes helped draw attention to the emotions they were trying to convey. Some people were juggling, a few were using tables as drums, and girls were dancing in beautiful flowy dresses in corsets. To express the inventor's extraordinary fascinations, the performers wore tacky costumes and funny makeup.

    </p>

    <p>
      One of my favourite scenes from the entire show was when a fisherman wearing a yellow raincoat picked a lady from the audience as a volunteer and brought her onto the stage. He pretended she was a visitor and tried to impress her. He offered water to her and before he came back with the cups, he pretended to be a few pets such as a bird, cat, and dog. Furthermore, the lights played a crucial role in helping the audience focus on the key points in this performance. The spotlight was centered on wherever the action was happening which helped emphasize the important parts.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the reasons why this production is so highly regarded is because of how everything blends together, to
      create one seamless performance - and that is exactly what “O” managed. “O”, pronounced eau (French for water),
      showcased a play so different from everything else, your eyes were literally glued onto the stage. It's success
      was completely dependent on the set design; because the show is entirely aquatic based, the stunts seen were
      extremely unique, almost always involving water. The superb lighting tricks to show brilliant images on the
      curtains also stood out to me, most notably with the yellow curtain, contrasting with the black silhouettes
      creating a scenery so cinematic you would think it was from a blockbuster movie. Furthermore, I must point out the
      incredible costuming worn and special effects during the fire display, with the material allowing the fire to burn
      for a long period of time without harming the actor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The soundtrack of this performance was flawless and they played music that fit each scenario. They used music effectively to make intense scenes stand out by making them more upbeat. All the sounds flowed together and the transitions were clean.

    </p>

    <p>
      A standout moment in this performance would have to be when people were wearing what looked like pink gymnastic suits, and wearing pink makeup. I loved how there was a stage surrounded by water where they remarkably flipped in the air and balanced on top of each other. I found this highly impressive since it takes a lot of upper body strength and balance to perform their stunts.
    </p>

    <p>If I were to give this performance a rating, I would give it a 30/30. This score would come from the creative costumes and makeup, the talented movement, the beautiful settings, good use of lighting, well-selected sounds, and the entertainment would each get 5/5 totalling up to 30/30. I loved watching the Cabinet of Curiosities and I recommend that others should definitely check it out. It is perfect for families and I'm sure kids will love it!</p>
