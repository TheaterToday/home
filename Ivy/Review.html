  <p class="caption">KURIOS - Cabinet of Curiosities</p>

  <div>
    <p> We all know the famous circus troupe, Cirque du Soleil. I used to have high expectations for Cirque du Soleil,
      with numerous positive reviews and ratings from different reporters and news sources. However, after watching one
      of their 60-minute specials, my impression of them has drastically changed.
    </p>

    <p> Their first 60-minute special was a combination of three shows: Cabinet of Curiosities, “O”, and LUIZA. Although
      the lighting, makeup and acrobatics were no doubt spectacular, the storyline did not make sense to the audience
      and came across as confusing and all over the place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Watching the Cabinet of Curiosities was interesting at the start, with the lighting being a large part of helping
      the audience understand the show. The actors had unique makeup looks that made them look otherworldly and caught
      the audience's attention, but the performance was focused on the movement, not the makeup. Spotlights were shone
      on key actors, helping the audience focus their attention. That being said, there's only so much that lighting and
      makeup can help with. In the first scene, there was only one interesting set-piece: the caterpillar coming onto
      the stage. After that, One of the performers juggled different objects for the majority of the scene, which didn't
      help engage the audience. Near the end of the show, we saw a mimer seemingly appear out of nowhere. Although the
      mimer was funny at some parts, when he started acting out different animals, I couldn't help but wonder what that
      had to do with the story. What was the purpose of the mimer coming out of the couch to act like different animals?
    </p>

    <p>
      The second show, “O”, was described by the Cirque du Soleil as “inspired by the concept of infinity and the
      elegance of water.” While watching this show, I can't deny the pure skill of the performers and how well they
      performed on water. One standout moment was when the “goddess” appeared out of nowhere and floated down. That was
      a pleasant surprise and brought someone different to the table. Nevertheless, it's still not clear how the
      performers expressed an idea of infinity, as all the audience saw was the performers doing impressive acrobatics
      and dances with different costumes and on different set pieces, such as the floating boat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third performance, LUIZA, was the best show out of the three: the first scene was fairly easy to understand,
      with the soundtrack nicely adding to the performance. However, after the first scene, it was hard to comprehend
      how the first scene was related to the second scene, where people started swinging and dancing on vertical swings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, the storyline of the show was extremely hard to follow and confusing, with acrobatics thrown in with
      unique makeup looks and costumes. I would rate this show 40 Toronto Stars out of 100 Toronto Stars. I wouldn't
      recommend going to this show unless you enjoy deciphering the storyline and love to go for a good challenge.
    </p>
