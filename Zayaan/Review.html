          <h3>Cirque du Soleil</h3>
          <p>
            Cirque du Soleil and their first 60-minute special, featuring the shows: KURIOS, O, and LUZIA caught the attention of many. In this review, we will be discussing what makes their performances so extraordinary and eye-catching.

              <h3>Cirque du Soleil - Cabinet of Curiosities</h3>
              <p>
                Kurios - Cabinet of curiosities showcased many talents. The music, lights and makeup were used to their utmost potential but the story was very unclear, nevertheless, I couldn't take my eyes off the performers. Watching the show live is surely entertaining with daring acts and comedic mime, watching it online ought to be better as one can see the show from multiple angles. An example of the lighting adding a fantastic effect is the beginning of the show when the scientist looks upwards to find two "monsters", the lights above spin adding a dramatic effect. The soundtrack from the mime was crucial because without it the story would be even worse, one example I liked was when the cat was digging. The music in the first act was upbeat and matched the mood well. One set I found amazing was when the juggler and the drummer were in sync, and a lady was walking across chairs; this moment flowed very smoothly despite there being many points of interest for the audience and that made it stand out to me. The makeup and costumes weren't flashy in this show but it did match the steampunk and ocean vibes.

            <h3>Cirque du Soleil - "O"</h3>
            <p>
              "O",  the water-themed show; once again the story is unclear but the daring stunts definitely make up for it. The lighting in "O" is nothing special but the soundtrack is amazing at setting the mood for the audience. An act I found to be incredibly intriguing was the boat with the presumed viking/cavemen, due to the dangerous and intense nature of this act I was on the edge of my seat. One part of the set in this act that made me curious was, the "boat" of people were performing up high but there were also two people on the ground; I find this unnecessary because all eyes are looking up. The makeup and costumes in this show were used to emphasize characters and provide background information about who or what the performers are playing. This show does not have a clear storyline too but out of the 3 shows, "O" is by far my favourite.

              <h3>LUZIA</h3>
              <p>
                LUZIA has many animal-themed acts based on Mexican culture. Once again the story is unclear but the creativity makes up for it. I loved the makeup and costume of the "butterfly" because the colours really stood out and it matched the theme exceptionally. One act I would like to give props to is the tiger mannequin. The set told a story of a tiger being afraid of the water and a person helping it overcome its fear. The tiger's movements were incredibly realistic which really made it stand out.

              Overall I would give this 70/100 Toronto Stars
