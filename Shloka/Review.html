        Just from the first ten minutes, one can tell that this was going to be
        an extraordinary experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine trying to make your audience laugh, cry, and wonder just through
        the use of costumes and acrobatics. It may sound difficult but, for the
        Cirque du Soleil, it's a piece of cake. This performance was truly an
        extravagant experience for people of all different ages. All the
        performers put their entire heart and soul into the act, creating a
        memorable experience for their audience. The show was a bit chaotic in
        the beginning as a lot of action was happening at once but after that,
        eyes were wide open all throughout.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the perspective of the audience who really enjoyed the show, the
        stage was showing a lot of pure emotion. Whether it was through the
        costumes, makeup, facial expressions, or just the acting in general. One
        moment the audience was laughing at a man pretending to be different
        animals, then they were wowing the talented acrobatic fish, and after
        that they were just mesmerized by the boat and ocean portion of the
        show. The audience was constantly amazed by what had to come next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the overall theme of the show was hard to understand, one part
        of the show that really stood out was when the performers used the pool
        as an ocean and a floating platform as an island. Some were synchronized
        swimming while others were performing dangerous acrobatics on a moving
        platform. Even though both groups were staging different moves, they
        were still somehow in perfect sync with the music as well as each other.
        There was also a scene with a hanging boat prop where men and women
        performed flying acrobatics. The synchronization here was the most
        impressive and interesting as they were moving the prop, while
        performing. The trust the men and women had for each other was crucial
        during this part of the show.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone can agree that the stage crew and make-up artists worked just as
        hard as the performers. Without all the beautiful makeup and costumes,
        the performance wouldn't have been as lavish. The lighting always
        matched the mood of whatever scene was happening on stage so, the entire
        atmosphere can be filled with the same emotion of either joy, fear, or
        sadness. The most impressive part was how the soundtrack perfectly
        corresponded with the actions of the performers. If they were to do
        something funny, then there would be a silly sound effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is truly amazing how many talented minds and performers it must have
        taken to put together something as extraordinary as the Cirque du
        Soleil. This is most definitely a show worth spending the money for as
        it is recommended by many people such as myself. My rating would most
        definitely be a solid nine out of ten.
