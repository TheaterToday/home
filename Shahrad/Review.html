        The audience watches in awe as performers jump off ladder and onto a net
        below, doing acrobatics midair without any fears. Cirque du Soleil has
        truly outdone themselves with their 3 performances; “Cabinet of
        Curiosities”, “O” and “LUZIA”.
      </p>

      <p>
        The performers maintain a gleeful and happy tone and demeanor throughout
        the first performance while doing difficult and potentially dangerous
        acrobatics, all whilst maintaining calm composure. This allowed the
        performance to contain an extra layer of dazzle and had me and the
        audience mesmerized and laughing at the performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The music fit the actions and the actions shown on stage which absorbed
        the audience more into the story. The usage of lighting highlighted
        parts of the performance and the focus of the stage at that moment in
        time, when the different acts started and ended and changing tone and
        emotions, such as blue light to convey sadness and yellow for
        energeticness or happiness.. The absence of music also allowed the
        performers to make sounds and not distract from the act. It almost
        couldn't be distinguished whether the actors, mainly the cat in the
        first performance, were making sounds or if they were outside sound
        effects. The seamless transition to the next performance was funny as
        well as engaging the viewers in the environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second performance, “O” (pronounced as “eau”, meaning water) starts
        out on a water covered stage after a dramatic scene. Keeping the center
        of the stage was beneficial to focusing the audiences' attention to the
        acrobatics happening in the floating center stage. The change of music
        and lighting to a made the transition in plot very clear and precise,
        while maintaining its fluidity. The outfits helped separate the
        performers who seemed almost identical, while still helping them fit in
        with their environment and the lighting. The set being mostly water
        intrigued me; how they used such a linear, basic environment in such a
        unique way was beyond belief. The use of lighting as a background was
        extraordinary and out of the box, an outstanding idea and very well
        executed. The costumes added to the performance by showing what the
        audience should focus on, and adding to the environment with the
        costumes, especially the fish scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next performance, another seamless transition from the last, while
        remaining serious, provides a bit of humor when the performer lights
        another's shoes on fire as he sits there, completely oblivious to the
        world around him as he slowly burns. This normally dangerous action is
        handled professionally by the performer and the technical team behind
        the performance, making his clothing and chair burn for so long without
        harming the actor. Stunts are why Cirque du Soleil is held in such high
        regard in the world of theater. The many hazardous things going on in
        this environment had the audience and I in awe, applauding. The prop
        animal blended in really well with the background and fooled the
        audience and I into almost believing it was a live animal. This
        performance was spectacular.
      </p>

      <p>
        My final rating is 8/10. It could potentially have more complex and
        dramatic story lines, however, it would be difficult to express in an
        entertaining theatrical manner and would add to the confusion the play
        already contains. I would definitely recommend this performance.
